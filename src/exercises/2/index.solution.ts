/*

Intro:

    All 2 users liked the idea of the community. We should go
    forward and introduce some order. We are in Germany after all.
    Let's add a couple of admins.

    Initially we only had users in the in-memory database. After
    introducing Admins, we need to fix the types so that
    everything works well together.

Exercise:

    Type "Person" is missing, please define it and use
    it in persons array and logPerson function in order to fix
    all the TS errors.

interface User {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    occupation: string;
}

interface Admin {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    role: string;
}

export type Person = User | Admin;

export const persons: Person[] = [
    {
        name: 'Max Mustermann',
        age: 25,
        occupation: 'Chimney sweep'
    },
    {
        name: 'Jane Doe',
        age: 32,
        role: 'Administrator'
    },
    {
        name: 'Kate MÃ¼ller',
        age: 23,
        occupation: 'Astronaut'
    },
    {
        name: 'Bruce Willis',
        age: 64,
        role: 'World saver'
    }
];

export function logPerson(user: Person) {
    console.log(` - ${user.name}, ${user.age}`);
}

persons.forEach(logPerson);
