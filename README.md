# TypeScript exercises

The goal: Let everyone play with many different TypeScript features
and get an overview of TypeScript capabilities and principles.

## Things to cover

 1. Basic typing.
 2. Refining types.
 3. Union types.
 4. Merged types.
 5. Generics.
 6. Type declarations.
 7. Module augmentation.
 8. Advanced type mapping.

## Rules and principles

 1. Avoid using `any` type at all costs.

 2. Difficulty quickly grows one exercise after another.

 3. Don't open next exercises before finishing previous ones.
    Next exercises may contain spoilers and will prevent you
    from enjoying the delightful process of TypeScript debugging.

 4. Feel free to send a pull-request with your solutions if you
    need some additional feedback.

 5. Provide feedback to the creator of these exercises.

 6. Enjoy.

## Installation and usage

 1. Make sure you have `node.js` (and `yarn` if you prefer it over `npm`)
    installed on your machine.

 2. Start by opening `exercises/exercise-00/index.ts`.

 3. Once done with the exercise, proceed to the next one.
